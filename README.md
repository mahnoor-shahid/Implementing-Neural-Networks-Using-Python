# Implementing Neural Networks using Python

This project consists of python files that are provided in parts as well as the main code with full implementation of Neural Networks using python and numpy.

# Purpose

> Primarily to understand the core concepts and intuition behind Neural Networks and to understand how different Deep learning frameworks works and how neural networks are implemented using the built in features.

# Prerequisites
 - Python Intermediate
 - Numpy Package Hands-On
 - Basic Coding Hands-On
 - Object Oriented Concepts
 - Basic Deep Learning / Neural Networks Knowledge
  
# Tools
Files can be opened using any tool that supports the .ipynb format. For example, Jupyter Notebook or PyCharm.

# Versions
